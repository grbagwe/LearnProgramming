# Enviornment

what we are trying to solve

# Models
what algorithm we are using
the trained algorithm 

# Actions
the thing that interacts with the env using the model

# Observation (States)
Information of the env given to the model to create predictions(take actions)

# Action
What is the agent going to do in the env per step

Can be classified as dicrete and continous

| Finite number of actions |                              A range of actions                             |
| Small number of actions  | when large number of possbile actions<br/>like 30000 options in servo moter |

            |       
Finite number of    | A range of actions with a continous value
possible actions    |
# Step
Process of the env. 
Each frame if env is fps
